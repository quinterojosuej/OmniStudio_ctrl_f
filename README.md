# OmniStudio_ctrl_f
### Hi there! Here is what I've being working on for the past little while. Yes this is something I faced during work. It is a new object (like OmniStudio) 
### and both an LWC and Apex class. Make a tab for it and add it to the OmniStudio App! 

## A fast explaination is linked here: https://medium.com/@expendablenottingham/omnistudio-ctrl-f-da2c5d280638
### thank you Mark Twain for giving me this out :D
